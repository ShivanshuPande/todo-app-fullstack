// put the package.json file first
npm init 

almost done with the backend lets goo 

created a signup 
signin
to get the todos
to create todos 

i think this much is enough for my basic one right now 

i will be adding isCompleted in the future also a button so that you can delete the todos which you do not want and-
edit them as well 
also add debouncing and search somehow so that the user can search from all the todos
